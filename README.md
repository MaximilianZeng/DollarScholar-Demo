# DollarScholar

DollarScholar is a gamified micro-learning platform for financial literacy. Our target user profile -- Patrick, is a young professional who wants to learn more about saving and planning for his future. But he has questions, challenges, and a lack of incentives to remedy these issues. 

Patrick is not alone. Young people (in particular, immigrants and underbanked group) are financially illiterate, but don’t have the proper incentives to learn more about their finances. These are the problems we are going to solve.

DollarScholar provides financial literacy to users like Patrick in the form of micro-learning.
DollarScholar is the DuoLingo of financial literacy; it’s a notification based mobile app that sends personalized financial content to keep users engaged via proper incentives.

DollarScholar app is conceptualized and design by the DollarScholar team (Bigco Studio class, Spring 2021) in collaboration with our partner EY Foundry. Due to time and resource constraints, the developed demo is a proof of product concept, and is taken by EY Foundry for further production.

For full product description, research and design process, please refer to: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CLgmON4KsQ2ojmSeGS-_X54Ou7WVdbmCMTnHmvAm_tw/edit?usp=sharing.

Many thanks for the support and guidance by our partner at EY Foundry: Nick, Daniel, and Coco.

## Traction

We’ve taken some concrete steps to de-risk our venture. The key highlights are extensive research, a user study with 24 users to refine our target market, refining our value proposition and feature list based on EY’s feedback, 3 design iterations, and a working prototype that we will show you today
